### Report

Output graphs for subtasks A1 and A2 are in the "output" directory
These graphs can be generated by running the "make analysis" command (do not run it without finishing this README)

The analysis is performed in analysis.py. Check the main() function, and the different subtasks will be shown under
different functions.

NOTE: Server integer IDs are internal to the load balancer in our implementation
We have chosen to expose only the server hostnames in all the analysis. Any hostname that's randomly generated is prefixed with "server_". So, for example, a random hostname could be "server_upxztyn"

### How to run?

```
# need to run only once
make setup

# run the following commands in the order given
# No Ctrl+C anywhere at any time
# If you do Ctrl+C, run "make stop" before doing "make run" again
make run
# Wait for a few seconds before running the next command
# so that the server is fully set up
make analysis
make stop
```
