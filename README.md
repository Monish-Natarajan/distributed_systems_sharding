### Report

Output graphs for subtasks A1 and A2 are in the `output` directory
These graphs can be generated by running the `make analysis` command (do not run it without finishing this README)

The analysis is performed in `analysis.py`. Check the `main()` function, and the different subtasks will be shown under
different functions.

NOTE: Server integer IDs are internal to the load balancer in our implementation
We have chosen to expose only the server hostnames in all the analysis. Any hostname that's randomly generated is prefixed with "server_". So, for example, a random hostname could be "server_upxztyn"

#### Subtask A1
![a1_n_3.png](output%2Fa1_n_3.png)  
<u>Observation and View:</u> We can see that the 10k requests have been distributed
evenly among the 3 servers. This shows that the consistent hashing
algorithm is working as expected and that we have a reasonably
good hash function.

#### Subtask A2
This subtask is trivial since the line plot will always follow the hyperbola 10000/N.  
<u>Reason:</u> Average load = Total number of requests / Number of servers = 10000/N  
Unless there are requests being dropped, the average load will always be 10000/N.

#### Subtask A3
##### Method
Three servers are instantiated by running `make run`, followed by
`python checker.py`. The checker script is interactive, and commands are entered
to add/remove servers, or print the current list of servers.



### How to run?

```
# need to run only once
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
make setup

# run the following commands in the order given
# No Ctrl+C anywhere at any time
# If you do Ctrl+C, run "make stop" before doing "make run" again

make run

# Wait for a few seconds before running the next command
# so that the server is fully set up

make analysis
# At this point, the script will interactively ask you which subtask
# to execute. Enter the subtask number and press enter.


make stop


# If you want to manually test the server, you can use

make run
python checker.py

# The checker script is interactive, enter commands without any
# arguments like add, rm, rep, and they'll be executed with
# random server hostnames.
```
